        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p className='paragraph para_right'>The B-BBEE ICT Sector Council was appointed by Minister on 24 September 2015. Their first priority was to align the B-BBEE ICT Sector Code with the Code of Good Practice 2013, whose primary objective was to strengthen transformation requirements in so far as natural black people are concerned.<br/><br/>  Although recognising the main priority as aligning the ICT Sector Code, the Council took the opportunity to also strengthen some of the elements of the Code to robustly drive transformation in the ICT Sector. In this regard the Ownership and Skills development requirements were strengthened. The rationale was to prevent practices of subverting real transformation requiring black ownership (voting rights and receiving dividends) as was applied through ownership schemes that did not provide real benefits for black people. Ownership bonus points could be earned through ownership for black women and people with disability.<br/><br/>  On the side of skills development, the Council ensured that companies can earn bonus points where they invest in skills developments for women, people with disabilities and unemployed black people.<br/><br/>  The above changed obviously also shook most big ICT entities from their comfort zone, as it meant that that B-BBEE ratings significantly went down due to the Amended B-BBEE ICT Sector Code.</p>
        <p className='paragraph'>In this regard, the Council began to receive many complaints and queries relating to the unfairness of the Code and even accusation of the Council trying to bankrupt them. For instance, where they could obtain 30 points through Broad Based Ownership Schemes, now they could only receive 3 points.<br/><br/>  It was under the above-mentioned circumstances that the Council requested the Department’s support to embark on a road show to ensure that all stakeholders in the sector are educated about the Code to ensure that all voices are heard, not only those who felt threated by the added pressure to transform.<br/><br/>  The stakeholder programme was designed to cover as many provinces as possible within a shorter period to maximise the impact. It therefore started in KwaZulu Natal (15 February 2016), followed by Bloemfontein (15 February 2016), Northern Cape (17 February 2017), North-West (20 February 2017), Western Cape (22 February 2017), Eastern Cape (24 February 2017), Mpumalanga (27 February 2017) and Limpopo (1 March 2017). The Gauteng engagement was shifted to the 28th of March 2017 due to the need to create more time for mobilisation as it is a more diverse province.</p>

        <h5 >The Stakeholder Engagements in the Provinces</h5>
        <p>One of the concerning aspects of the engagements was the limited participation by entities. As it became obvious later on, the entities seemed to have been afraid of being in the same place as SMMEs and other beneficiaries of transformation in the Sector, as they would have been expected to account for their intransigence in respect of implementing transformation. A lot of SMMEs seemed to express significant levels of frustrations about lack of transformation and the window-dressing attitudes of big companies who took advantage of destitute emerging black businesses and aspiring black individual businesspeople.</p>

        <h5 >Durban</h5 >
        <p>The Durban Stakeholder engagement: The attendance represented a diversity of stakeholders from ordinary citizens, local government, BITF, SMMEs, Qualifying Small Enterprises (QSEs). Verification agencies, media and entities (though very few). The verification agencies, raised technical issues relating to the Code, including concerns of measured entities in terms of the effective date of the Code, stringent skills and ownership requirements and areas where they felt the Code did not provide adequate details. The importance of having a high representation of Verification Agencies is that they are important stakeholders in educating the entities about the Code.</p>

        <h5 >Cape Town</h5 >
        <p>The event was hosted at The Barn, in Cape Town. Councillor Schofield raised concerns about the lack of transformation in The Barn itself, indicating that the representation of Black people is still at an unacceptable level, even though the centre was created to enable more Black people to access opportunities in the ICT Sector. The audience was diverse in terms of representation though the issues remained primarily around SMME issues, with a few technical questions raised around the Amended Code. An expression of interest for future engagement with the Council was expressed, specifically due to the big entities not being in attendance. These are entities that prefer to speak directly to the Council whenever they had specific issues of concern, sometimes even sending advisors. The Council acknowledged the need for future engagements, as soon as big business is adequately mobilised in the province.</p>

      <div className='eachDiv' >
        <h5 >East London</h5 >
        <p>This session was the worst attended, ending with the Councillors engaging informally with the few individuals who attended, which also included the BITF leadership. There was acknowledgement to the need to revisit the province in future. There was also acknowledgement of the importance of the role of convenors in the mobilisation of stakeholders.</p>
      </div >
      <div className='eachDiv' >
        <h5 >Mpumalanga</h5 >
        <p>Attendance was mainly from SMMEs, Government and BITF. There was also a representative from a Verification Agency. There was vigorous engagement mainly from SMME representatives and members of the BITF, highlighting the same issues which were highlighted in Bloemfontein.<br/><br/> Further engagements happened after the meeting when the attendees engaged the Councillors separately and informally to get guidance on the Code and other related issues. From the Council side, as with other small provinces, was that people tended to believe that opportunities came from government, in the form of tenders, rather than the private sector itself.</p>
      </div >
      <div className='eachDiv' >
        <h5 >Polokwane</h5 >
        <p>The province seemed to have a bigger and diverse audience, from big companies, government, and people with disabilities, black business owners and cooperatives including SMMEs. There was therefore engagements on the technical aspects of the Code, the benefit of the Code to SMMEs, the partnerships and benefits of entering into partnerships with big companies without being absorbed to meet B-BBEE requirements. The audience also seemed to engage much more than was possible within the time that was available.<br/><br/> The Council therefore acknowledged the need to visit the province again as the indication was that there was a bigger audience that could have wished to participate.</p>
      </div >
      <div className='eachDiv ' >
        <h5>Gauteng</h5 >
        <div className='picDiv' >
        <img src={Councillor} alt="Councillor" style={{ marginRight: '2%' }} />
        <p>The Gauteng province had the most diverse stakeholder base compared to all other provinces. Disappointingly, Vodacom and Neotel did not have any representation. These companies have however been engaging directly with the Council. It therefore became important for the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson to, in their presentations, highlight the priority elements of the Code, namely Ownership, Management Control and Skills Development as high impact areas in the Code, without diminishing the importance of other elements.</p>

        <h5 >Conclusions</h5 >
        <p>What became clear out of the engagements was that there was firstly, an understanding that transformation in the sector is necessary, and no longer negotiable. The stakeholders also realised that embracing transformation, starting with complying with the Amended Sector Code, would be an important step in doing successful business in South Africa, especially if they wanted to do business with government.</p>
